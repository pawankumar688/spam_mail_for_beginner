#BTS SPAM Mail Predictor for beginer:

Spam mail predictior:
Use cases:
    As we know our time is very important and valuabe which we can't or don't want to waste on useless tasks, spam mail is one of the obsticals which want to consume our valuable time, but we don't have to worry about it b\c of machine learning help us to outomate the process of detecting spam mail and a important or geniunmail. Though there tone of projects who already made solve the issue.
What I bring to the table:
    If I honestly speacking not something knew, and I also not a expert in machine learning " YET " but for this reason it make me a better observer for a beginner who get overwelmed by when they see this kind of project for first time because I understand them better, why You might ask?, that's because I was one of them some months ago.
Important thing before start:
    First for beginner you need to keep this in mind by just looking at this code and structure, you can't learn compleatly you need to practince, make some mistakes, try to solve those mistakes, solve them and began to next stage and make mistakes again, and repeat it in loop, and it is perfectly fine if you can't understand it in first try or second, third, just keep go on and eventually it will become very easy for you, because a great man once said " Practice makes men perfect " which is absolutely true, don't bleave me? just try it yourself and you will findout.
    Now for those who are already expert in this filled, if you find any kind of mistakes or anykind of sugestion for me regarding this topic or any please let me know, I really want to learn from my mistakes and those are not just Shallow words I really want to learn specially the from the experts like you.
    "THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME"
